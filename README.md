## Section 2: How to Find a Signal

Now the iPhone will need an internet connection to continue. Only two types of connections are allowed: either a Wi-Fi connection or a connection via cellular service. Choose the option you need accordingly.

- **Option 1:** How to Connect through Wi-Fi:
  - Connect the iPhone to your Wi-Fi by choosing your Wi-Fi network from the list of networks found by the iPhone (a password may be required if your network requires it for connection).

- **Option 2:** Using cellular service:
  - Using the needle provided in the box, insert the needle into the hole on the left side of the iPhone. A small platform will pop out. Input your SIM card and then push the platform back into its place.
